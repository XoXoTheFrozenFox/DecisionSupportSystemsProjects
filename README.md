# Applied assignment A

If any investors would like to invest in "ByteBazaar", a computer-part shop, the best choice would be to invest in preferred stock or corparate bonds. The best choice for venue would be to stay at the current venue and to not do a market research. We forecast a profit of R245330 for September which is one of the highest forecast in the given periods. We are very optimistic for the future of "ByteBazaar".

 

# Applied assignment B

The EOQ of "ByteBazaar" is 200, which is equal to the demand. This leaves the optimal policy for orders as 1, which means that we only order stock once a year. It would be good for "ByteBazaar" to spread out orders more so that orders are consistent throughout the year rather then one large order. If there should be a change in economy where people are less likely to spend money on computer parts, "ByteBazaar" will have a lot of stock with no customers buying there products which can hurt the business and even in the long-term close it. According to questions 2's analysis with the PERT chart, there are two critical paths. The first critical path is B Select operators and D Announce new service which has a duration of 9 weeks. The second critical path is B Select operators, C Train operators and F Test new operators on equipment with a duration of 9 weeks too. This means that the two critical paths finish in the same week, therefore the two critical paths finish the project in the same week which is optimal. The total cost for the entire process represented by the PERT is R38000.

# Applied assignment C

Our company, ByteBazaar, currently holds the upper hand in the market share vector. Even when combining the market shares of our competitors, Digital Haven and TechTrove, they remain in the minority and cannot surpass ByteBazaar. The market is expected to stabilize within 15 periods, bringing a sense of reassurance for our company.
